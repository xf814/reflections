When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
To share file with others or when colaborating with others.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because if it updated automatically my unfinished version may be presented online and I may not want that.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork:only from github server to local
Clone:source and goal not limit
Branch:only change one repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
So that we can resolve conflict between local and github easily.
