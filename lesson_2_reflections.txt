What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory appears. So that git program can know it's a repository and has a place to save history of files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Seperate the files that will be in the commit and the files that will not.
