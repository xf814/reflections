What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git directory appears. So that git program can know it's a repository and has a place to save history of files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Seperate the files that will be in the commit and the files that will not.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Make sure that the files in the staging area are in one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
If I want to make experimental changes or another version of the program while preserving the original version, using brnaces will help.
