How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
If the old version has no bugs but the new version has, then the bug is definitely coming from the change from the old version to the new version. So if I can find the different between two version, I can look for bugs just in the different part of the code rather than the whole program, and that can save me much time and effort. 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I can find the bug more quickly, so I can write program more quickly, saving my time for doing other things more meaningful.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Creating commit manually can ensure that every commit is a logical one that can be understand, so it's more useful and effective. But it needs user to form a habbit of committing and it takes some effort to commit manually.
Having versions automatically saved is convenient. But the version may not be a meaningful one and it may not be of much help in finding bugs.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Because git is used by programmers, and writing program often requires to change different files together. But Goolge Docs is used for other purposes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
First use git log to find the files that I need to look at. Then use git diff to compare the two files.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Even if I break something I can change it back.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Use it when I write other programs.
